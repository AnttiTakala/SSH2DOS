INTRODUCTION 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

	SSH2DOS (SSH2D386) is an SSH client which provides a telnet-like
	interactive login shell to remote hosts. It can be used to run
	commands on remote hosts as well.

	SFTPDOS (SFTP386) and SCPDOS (SCP2D386) are secure file transfer
	utilities capable of transferring files from remote to local or
	from local to remote machines.

	TELNET (TEL386) is the good old telnet utility.

	These programs can run on low-end machines (8086+) when
	compiled as real-mode applications (OpenWatcom large model),
	so it's an ideal solution to connect from el-cheapo machines
	or DOS compatible PDAs.
	The 386 version (OpenWatcom flat model) is much faster,
        but it requires at least a 386 machine.

	Supported cipher: AES
	Implemented SSH protocol version: 2.0
	Supported authentication methods: keyboard-interactive,
	public key and password

        All utilities support SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies with
        user authentication support. This is handy if you're
        behind a firewall.

	SSH2DOS is based on the WATT-32 TCP/IP library, Putty SSH client
	for Windows, the ZLIB compression library and the CVT100
	terminal emulation package.


INSTALLATION 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

	Unzip the package with subdirectory support (pkunzip -d).

	If you have the binary package, no installation is needed.
	Edit the wattcp.cfg and hosts file first, then install a packet
	driver, or set up your PPP connection if you have a modem.

        To compile the sources, you'll also need the WATT-32 and ZLIB
        sources.
	To build the binaries, build ZLIB and WATT-32 first. Be sure,
        that the WATT_ROOT environment variable points to the proper
	WATT-32 source directory.
	Copy zlib_f.lib or zlib_l.lib (depending on your target)
	to the lib\ directory under the ssh2dos source tree.
        Now run 'make -f filename', where 'filename' is needed makefile:
        watcom_l.mak - OpenWatcom real mode target (for 8086 machines)
        watcom_f.mak - OpenWatcom protected mode target (for 80386 machines)

	Tested compilers:
	- OpenWatcom 1.x


DOCUMENTATION 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

	To get help for SSH2DOS and SFTPDOS, please use the /? command
	line option.

	-i <identity file> Public key file for public key authentication.
			   You can create keys with PuTTYGen or Linux
			   ssh-keygen.

	-t <terminal type> This string is passed to the server as the
			   'TERM' environment variable. The default is
			   'xterm'. You can set any string here, but be
			   sure to use a correct keymap file. For the
			   nicest results, I recommend 'linux' with the
			   linux keymap file, if your host supports it.

	-p <port number>   Port to connect to at the remote host.
			   The default SSH port is 22.

	-k <keymap file>   Keymap file. Three sample keymap files are
			   included in the package (for vt100/102,
			   linux and xterm-color terminals). The 'xterm'
			   keymap is hard-wired into SSH2DOS, so keymap
			   files should only contain the differences
			   from the 'xterm' keymap.

	-m <mode>          Video mode. Valid modes are:
			   '80x25', '80x60', '132x25' and '132x50'.
			   A VESA VGA card is required for extended modes.

	-s <password>      You can specify your password here. This is
			   useful (but INSECURE) for batch files.

	-l <log file>	   Log the whole session to a file.

	-a <minutes>	   Send keepalive packets. SSH2DOS sends IGNORE
			   packets in every 'minutes'.

	-b <COM[1234]>     Copy all output to a Brailab PC adapter
			   connected to the specified COM port.
			   This adapter is useful for the visually
			   challenged.

	-g		   Use Diffie-Hellman group1 exchange. This may
			   be useful in case of connection problems.

	-P		   Use a non-privileged local port.

	-C		   Enable compression (for real-mode SSH2DOS, you'll
			   need as much free conventional memory as
			   possible).

	-S		   Suppress status line.

	-B		   Use BIOS for screen writes (no direct video access).
                           This may help visually challenged people.

	-V		   Disable VESA BIOS. This can be useful to avoid
			   changing to full-screen mode under WindowsXP
			   or if you have other mode switching problems.

	-n		   Add CR if server sends only LF. Use this to
			   prevent the 'staircase effect'.

	-d		   Save raw SSH packets to file 'debug.pkt'.

	-v		   Be more verbose at startup.


	During interactive session, SHIFT + PGUP/PGDOWN can be used
	to view the scrollback area.

	If the connection seems to be broken and no disconnection
	happens automatically, you may terminate SSH2DOS by
	pressing the ALT-X key combination.

	DOS shell can be invoked using the ALT-E key combination.

	To use proxy support, you must set either SOCKS_PROXY or
	HTTP_PROXY environment variable. The syntax is:
	  [username:password@]proxyhost[:port] 
	The default SOCKS port is 1080, HTTP is 3128.
	Some examples:
	  SOCKS5 proxy with no user authentication using default port:
		SOCKS_PROXY=proxy.foo.bar
	  HTTP proxy with authentication using port 8080:
		HTTP_PROXY=myusername:mypassword@proxy.foo.bar:8080


EXAMPLES컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

	Connect to a linux box:
	  ssh2dos -t linux -k linux.kbd username hostname

	Connect to a host using the 386 version and compression:
	  ssh2d386 -C username hostname

	Connect and run a shell script called 'scriptname':
	  ssh2dos username hostname nohup scriptname &

	Connect to a host with sftp 386 version:
	  sftp386 username@hostname
	Then use the 'help' command to get help.

	Copy a file from the remote host to local:
	  scpdos username@hostname:path_to_remote_file local_file

	Create a batch file to upload to files, "file1" and "file2",
	to a remote directory called "test" on "remotehost".
	This batch file "example.txt" should look like:
	  open username@remotehost
	  cd test
	  put file1
	  put file2
	  bye
	Now use SFTP to do the actual transfer:
	  sftpdos -b example.txt
